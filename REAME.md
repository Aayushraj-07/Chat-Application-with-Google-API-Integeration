                            ___________________________________________________

This is a simple web-based chat application that integrates with the Google Gemini API (1.5 version) to generate AI-based responses. The application features a typing effect, theme toggle (light/dark mode), message history storage, and message copying functionality.

       2. Typing effect to simulate real-time chat.
       3. Theme toggle (Light/Dark mode) with persistent storage.
       4. Message history stored in the browser’s localStorage.
       5. Copy-to-clipboard functionality for each message.
       6. Loading indicators while the AI processes the response.

       1. HTML: Markup language for structuring the application.
       2. CSS: Styling the user interface, including theme management.
       3. JavaScript: Handles all dynamic interactions, API requests, and UI updates.
